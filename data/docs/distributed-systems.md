# Distributed Systems Notes

A distributed system is a set of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system.
Key themes: partial failure, time, concurrency, coordination, replication, and trade-offs.

**Common tools**
- consensus (Raft/Paxos)
- replication and quorum reads/writes
- message queues and log-based systems
- idempotency + retries
